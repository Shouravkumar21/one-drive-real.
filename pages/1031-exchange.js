                                        <p className="text-gray-700">To qualify for a 1031 exchange, the properties involved must be held for investment purposes or used in a business or trade. This includes residential rental properties, commercial buildings, vacant land, and industrial properties.</p>

                                        <p className="text-gray-700">The properties exchanged must be of “like-kind,” meaning they must be similar in nature or character, even if they differ in grade or quality. For example, you can exchange an apartment building for a commercial office space, but not for a personal residence.</p>
