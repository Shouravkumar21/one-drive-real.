                                At One Drive Realty, we recognize the importance of innovative and sustainable building practices, which is why we offer services related to envelope structures in real estate development. An envelope structure refers to the outer shell of a building, designed to protect the interior from external elements while maintaining energy efficiency and structural integrity.
                            </p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Are Envelope Structures?</h2>
                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                                The building envelope consists of all the elements of a structure that separate the interior from the exterior. This includes walls, roofs, windows, doors, and foundations. The envelope plays a crucial role in determining the energy efficiency, comfort, and durability of a building.
                            </p>
