                                At One Drive Realty, we offer an innovative approach to real estate investment through Unit Share Certificates. This method provides a flexible and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to real estate without the complexities of traditional property ownership. Unit Share Certificates represent a portion of ownership in a real estate asset or portfolio, allowing investors to benefit from property appreciation and income generation without directly managing the property.

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Are Unit Share Certificates?</h2>
                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                                Unit Share Certificates are a form of investment that allows individuals to own a share of a real estate asset. Each certificate represents a fractional ownership of a property or a group of properties, giving investors a stake in the income and value generated by those assets.
                            </p>
